      "description": "I'm Jordan Yamada.Before Code Fellows, I was an Air Traffic Controller for the US Marine Corps. I enjoyed my time in the service, but I always felt that there was something missing in my role. See, though I can't paint or play music, I've always wanted an outlet for my creative energy. I've been lucky to have found that software development matches my creativity with my love for puzzle-solving and tinkering. I would like to find a role in the tech industry that keeps to that spirit, and if I can have a chance to make a positive impact in the world, even better.",
